  <p>Robert Anderson was the son of Doctor James Anderson and Margaret Seton, of Mounie. The Setons were a prominent Scottish family, and Anderson's brother later added Seton to the Anderson name, in honour of his mother's family.
Robert was in NSW in 1800, where Governor Hunter appointed him an ensign in the NSW Corps. He left the colony in 1805, for India.
