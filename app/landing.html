      <h2>Robert Anderson Seton</h2>
      <h3>Drawings / Album of watercolour drawings of Australian natural history</h3>
      <p>Robert Anderson was the son of Doctor James Anderson and Margaret Seton, of Mounie. The Setons were a prominent Scottish family, and Anderson's brother later added Seton to the Anderson name, in honour of his mother's family.
    Robert was in NSW in 1800, where Governor Hunter appointed him an ensign in the NSW Corps. He left the colony in 1805, for India. Some correspondence by Robert Anderson, written during his time in NSW and which refers in part to his interest in natural history, is held by the University of Aberdeen Library, Seton Family Papers 2787 (see Australian Joint Copying Project microfilm M 2398). <a href="/seton">See drawings</a></p>
