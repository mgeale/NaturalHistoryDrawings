            in 1800, where Governor Hunter appointed him an ensign in the NSW Corps. He left the colony in 1805, for India. Some correspondence by Robert Anderson, written during his time in NSW and which refers in part to his interest in natural history,
            is held by the University of Aberdeen Library, Seton Family Papers 2787 (see Australian Joint Copying Project microfilm M 2398).</p> -->
